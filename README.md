# Groupify - The Teachers App
Groupify is an iOS application designed to reduce the toil of mundane tasks for teachers so they can focus on what actually matters, teaching. The app can import csv data of students and add them to a class list that the app stores. The app can take attendance very efficiently by just selecting the students that are gone. The app holds and tracks this data to see how often the students are gone. The app can also make groups based on various factors such as grades, attendance records, alphabetical order, or random selection. The app can save and export groups for future use. The app can make it easy to call on students too with different selection modes such as fair, which ensures students each get called on similar amounts, or based on grade if you are trying to make the class speed up or get struggling kids involved. The app also has a multi-functionality number generator for miscellaneous teacher activities.
